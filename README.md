# NLP-for-Album-Review-Sentiment-Analysis

This repo contains an NLP sentiment analysis I conducted. I carried out this analysis on reviews for Dark Side of the Moon published by users of [rateyourmusic.com](https://rateyourmusic.com/). The goal of this project was to assist a fictional record label in understanding how they can analyze reviews with or without labels on a large scale

I enjoyed working on this project as it took on two phases, each requiring the use of a different set of machine learning techniques. 
The first phase unsupervised learning using NLP methods, looking for topics within the reviews. The second involved classification modeling using the review ratings as labels. 

This repo contains the following items:
* The [slide deck](https://github.com/bronsonnh/NLP-for-Album-Review-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/main/Slide%20Deck%20-%20Natural%20Language%20Processing%2C%20Album%20Sentiment%20Review.pdf)  I used to present my findings from this project 
* A [report](https://github.com/bronsonnh/NLP-for-Album-Review-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/main/Report%20on%20NLP%20Analyses.md) describing my process, as well as general information about the project  
* Two Jupyter notebooks containing the code I used to analyze the data

I have some ideas for extensions to this project, including a larger scale review across albums and artists within the Rock or Classic Rock genres. If you have any ideas or comments, feel free to reach me at [bronsonnh@gmail.com](bronsonnh@gmail.com).
